Descriptions for each input are as follows:

        -   smar : gaussian smearing for metals;

        -   random : Initial wave function initiation using random
            number

        -   usp : The pseudopotential used is the type of ultrasoft
            psudopotential

        -   celldm : Crystallographic constants

        -   ecutefc : kinetic energy cutoff (Ry) for wavefunctions

        -   ecutrho : Kinetic energy cutoff (Ry) for charge density and
            potential For norm-conserving pseudopotential

        -   ibrav : Bravais-lattice index

        -   iband : Number of electronic states (bands) to be
            calculated.

        -   banyak\_atom : number of types of atoms in the unit cell

        -   nat : number of atoms in the unit cell

        -   mix : mixing factor for self-consistency

        -   pos : atomic positions are in cartesian coordinates, in
            units of the lattice parameter (either celldm(1) or A).

        -   k\_point : read k-points in cartesian coordinates.
