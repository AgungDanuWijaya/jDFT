Density functional theory(DFT)
==============================

Density functional theory (DFT) is a successful theory in deep Physics
and Chemistry last half century \[1--4\]. This theory is used in
predicting the structure and properties of atoms, molecules, and solids
where this theory is very useful in finding the main material of
Material Design, where one tries to create new materials with certain
characteristics. This theory also made its way in Biology as a tool in
conducting investigations of DNA, proteins, etc. DFT applications are
generally carried out in what is called the Kohn-Sham scheme \[5\],
where this scheme uses a non-interaction method. electronic system to
calculate the density of interacting systems \[6\]. The Kohn-Sham scheme
leads to the following equality. $$\label{eq1}
\begin{split}
  [-\dfrac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V_{ext(\textbf{r})}+
  \int d^3r'\dfrac{n(\textbf{r}')}{|\textbf{r}-\textbf{r}'|}+V_{xc}[n](\textbf{r})]\Psi_k(\textbf{r})=\epsilon_k \Psi_k(\textbf{r})
\end{split}$$

where the first term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons, the
second is the external potential, the third term is the Hartree
potential that describes the classical electrostatic repulsion between
the electrons. The last term is the exchange-correlation (xc) potential
$V_{xc}[n]$ where defined by $$\label{eq2}
\begin{split}
  V_{xc}[n](\textbf{r})=\dfrac{\delta E_{xc}[n]}{\delta n(r)}
\end{split}$$ $E_{xc}[n]$ is the xc energy functional. Note that by
$[n]$ we denote that the quantity is a functional of the electronic
density, $$\label{eq2_1}
\begin{split}
  n(\textbf{r})=\sum^{occ}_i |\Psi_k(\textbf{r})|^2
\end{split}$$ where the sum runs over the occupied states
